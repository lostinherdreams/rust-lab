# Rust Control Flow Basics

This Rust project showcases fundamental control flow constructs in Rust programming.

## Overview

The code within this project covers various control flow mechanisms in Rust:

### `if` Expressions

Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks to conditionally execute code based on different conditions. Additionally, it showcases the inline `if` expression that assigns values based on a condition.

### Loops

#### `loop`

Illustrates an infinite loop and a loop that breaks when a certain condition is met. Additionally, it shows the use of labels in loops to control break statements.

#### `while` Loop

Demonstrates how to use `while` loops for conditional repetition and iterating over elements in an array.

#### `for` Loop

Shows iteration over collections using `for`, iterating over elements in an array, and using ranges in `for` loops.

### Control Flow Constructs

Includes the use of `break` and `continue` statements within loops to control program flow.
